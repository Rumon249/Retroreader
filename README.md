Retro-Reader !!

We chose the 'Blast from the Past' topic. Retro Reader doesnâ€™t just look retro, but it feels like an old-school website reimagined for today. It celebrates the nostalgia of colorful uis and pop-up chaos, and packages it in a smooth, joyful, animation-driven reading experience for new users. Kids and adults alike can share in the experience of reading children's books on the platform from a variety of genres with unique animations for certain highlighted words. 

We coded Retroreader using:
  1. React + Vite for the component based structure (Java & HTML)
  2. CSS for styling components
  3. Framer Motion for animations and popups
  4. A Canvas API powered mouse trail
  5. JSX arrays for story pages
