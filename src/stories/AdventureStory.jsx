      <h2>🗺️ The Lost Map</h2>
      <p>
        In a tiny attic filled with old books and forgotten toys, Max found a dusty scroll hidden in a box. It was a hand-drawn treasure map — with dragons, mountains, and an "X" marked in pink glitter.

        Max packed a sandwich, grabbed his lucky compass, and set off into the backyard, which suddenly felt like a jungle. He crossed puddle rivers, climbed tree-mountains, and dodged lawn gnome pirates.

        Finally, under the old oak tree, Max dug into the dirt... and found a glowing marble and a note: “Adventure lives in you.” He smiled and ran back home, ready for his next quest.
