      <h2>ðŸ§š Sparkle in the Garden</h2>
      <p>
        Every night after sunset, the backyard garden came to life. Fireflies blinked like fairy lanterns, and the flowers hummed gentle lullabies. Hidden among the petals was Lila â€” the tiniest fairy in the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, a strong wind swept through and blew away her sparkle dust! She couldnâ€™t fly without it. With the help of a brave ladybug and a sleepy snail, she journeyed through the flower beds to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they reached the tallest sunflower, the wind gave one last gentle swirl, and her dust sparkled back into the air. Lila giggled, fluttered her wings, and flew high, painting stars into the sky as a thank-you.
